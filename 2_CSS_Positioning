CSS Positions-
_____________________________________

Static relative absolute fixed sticky

1. Static property
Be default we have static property.
We can’t apply top bottom left right and z-index property when it’s static positioning.

Z-index is used for stacking the content on one other , then content with higher z-index gets on top of the other.


HTML elements are positioned static by default.


Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.


An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page:
______________________________________

2. Relative positioning
Means it will be relative to its normal positioning.(which means when it was a position static)


Gap is only left by the relative elements that to for original position

Original space is always maintained.

It gives overlapping feature.

Doesn’t break the element from normal flow of page.

An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.


Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.

3. Absolute Positioning-
Takes the element out from the normal flow of the page.
 Its relative to the containing element, if no containing element its to the view port


If no parent is there it takes with respect to view port, breaks out of flow.

If parent is there it should havve relative, absolute or fixed


Then it wikl take position with respect to parent


An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).
However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.

4. Fixed position
Breaks from the normal flow, doesn’t work out like combibation like absolute relative’

An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element.
A fixed element does not leave a gap in the page where it would normally have been located.
Notice the fixed element in the lower-right corner of the page. Here is the CSS that is used:

1. Need to use sticky position - it needs top with sticky to work to specify who should it stick always add top with sticky to make hot stick at a serctian place
An element with position: sticky; is positioned based on the user's scroll position.
A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. It is positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed).
